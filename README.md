# FHIR-IG-Human-Services-Directory

The FHIR IG for Human Services Directory describes the architectural considerations for accessing data from a directory of social services. The Guide will specify methods of aligning FHIR resources that describe healthcare provider directory information â€“ with the Human Services Data Set (HSDS), an industry standard for service directory data exchange that describes information about human service agencies, the services they provide, and locations where they are offered. The Guide will also specify RESTful methods of for accessing data from HSDS-compliant directories, in alignment with the Human Service Data API protocols (HSDA). Each profile within will define the minimum mandatory elements, extensions and terminology requirements that MUST be present to enable interoperability between FHIR systems and sources of HSDS data.
