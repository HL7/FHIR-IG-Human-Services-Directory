Mapping: HSDSOrganizationToHSDS

Title:    "HSDS"
Description: """This section describes the way HSDS version 2.0.1 elements are mapped from HSDS tables to this FHIR HSDSOrganization profile. The left hand column contains the FHIR HSDSOrganization element name; the right hand column contains the HSDS table.element and any implementation/transformation rules required to support the mapping.

The HSDS specification (v.2.0.1) served as the initial basis for requirements, and the mapping/alignment of HSDS data elements to profiles contained in the FHIR IG for Human Service Directories, STU1. HSDS Version 2.0.1 applies string datatypes to nearly all HSDS table 'id' fields/ data elements, including the id field associated with each HSDS [table] (e.g. organization.id [organization], location.id [location], service.id [service], phone.id [phone], etc.). In the next version of HSDS, v.3.0, each HSDS table.id field will be defined using the UUID data type.

FHIR Resource .ids  (and the .ids in their profiles) are defined using the FHIR id datatype, a string that supports "Any combination of upper- or lower-case ASCII letters ('A'..'Z', and 'a'..'z', numerals ('0'..'9'), '-' and '.', with a length limit of 64 characters. (This might be an integer, an un-prefixed OID, UUID or any other identifier pattern that meets these constraints.)". 

Because UUIDs provide uniqueness to data/resources when they are exchanged across multiple systems, it is recommended that implementers of the FHIR IG for Human Services Directories support UUIDs in all HSDS id fields that are mapped to FHIR .id data elements."""
* id  -> "organization.id Note: Each organization must have a unique system identifier in the source system."
* meta  -> "Note: The HSDS metadata table contains a record of the changes that have been made to the data in order to maintain provenance information."
* meta.id -> "metadata.id Note: This data element may be ignored as having the id for the date metadata isn't essential. If populated, it should be id corresponding to the latest action date for given organization as described below."
* meta.lastUpdated  -> "metadata.last_action_date Note: The date when data was changed. Since there may be more than one metadata record for each organization, the latest max(last_action_date) needs to be used from metadata where (FHIR) Organization.id = (HSDS) metadata.resource_id."
* text -> "No Source. May be excluded from the mapping. Note: This DomainResource.text is meant for textual summary of the resource so organization description is mapped to the org-description extension added by Plan-Net profile."
* extension[qualification]  -> "extension[qualification]:code.url = 'code' extension[qualification]:code.valueCodeableConcept.text = service.accreditations 
Note: This is a GAP in HSDS that can be resolved by having qualifications collected at the organization level. As a workaround, suggested mapping uses the unique set of accreditations from service and concatenated for the organization level as described below."
* extension[org-description]  -> "organization.description Note: This Plan-Net profile added this extension for organization description as opposed to using DomainResource.text data element which is meant for textual summary of the resource."
* identifier
* identifier.id  -> "No Source. May be excluded from the mapping. Note: This data element may be ignored as having the id for the identifier record  isn't essential and is not available in HSDS since the tax ID is directly on the organization table."
* identifier.use  -> "Fixed value = 'official' Note: Since the organization business identifier in HSDS is organization.tax id  which is used for official purpose,  this element is to be set with a fixed value 'official' drawn from the code system IdentifierUse http://hl7.org/fhir/identifier-use."
* identifier.type -> "Fixed value = 'TAX' Note: Since the organization business identifier in HSDS is organization.tax id  which is used for the tax,  this element is to be set with a fixed value 'TAX'  drawn from the IdentifierType code system â€“ http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203 [an HL7-defined code system of concepts specifying type of identifier]."
* identifier.system -> "Fixed value = 'urn:us:gov:irs' Note: Since the organization business identifier in HSDS is organization.tax id  which is issued by IRS,  this element is to be set with a fixed value with IRS URN."
* identifier.value  -> "organization.tax_id Note: This is the only business identifier in HSDS at this time."
* identifier.period  -> "organization.year_incorporated Note:  HSDS organization.year_incorporated may not always be the same as when the TAX ID was issued (especially if a company merged or split). Technically year_incorporated  is a GAP in FHIR and should be added as an extension. Also the effective date of the identifier (mapped to period here) is GAP in HSDS. But until both of those GAPs are addressed, the above mapping is proposed as a work around."
* identifier.assigner -> "Fixed value = 'www.irs.gov' Note: This is GAP in HSDS but it can be implicitly inferred. Since the organization business identifier in HSDS is organization.tax id  which is issued by IRS,  this element is to be set with a fixed value with IRS website link as a reference." 
* active  -> "Fixed value = 'true' Note: HSDS organization does not have a status but this is required in FHIR so fixed value is proposed to indicate that organization is active."

* name  -> "organization.name"
* alias  -> "organization.alternate_name Note: Since there is only one alternate name in HSDS but the alias is an array (list) in FHIR, this will map to the first occurrence of the array."
* telecom -> "Note: This FHIR structure contains contact details of the organization using the ContactPoint datatype (Details for all kinds of technology-mediated contact points for a person or organization, including telephone, email, etc.)."
* telecom.id -> "No Source. May be excluded from the mapping. Note: This data element may be ignored as having the id for the telecom record  isn't essential and not always available in the HSDS (e.g. phone id is available but there is no separate id for email or website URL)."
* telecom.extension[contactpoint-availabletime]  -> "No Source. Note: This is a GAP in HSDS. This FHIR extension is added by Plan-Net profile and represents available hours for the telecom (e.g. customer service phone hours from 8AM-6PM M-F). There is no equivalent mapping to this data element in  HSDS since the HSDS schedule table contains details of when a service or location is open, and is not a phone line associated with an organization."
* telecom.extension[via-intermediary]  -> "No Source. Note: This is GAP in HSDS. This FHIR extension added by Plan-Net profile represents a reference to an alternative point of contact.

* telecom.rank -> "No Source. Note: This a GAP in HSDS. In FHIR, it is used to specify a preferred order in which to use a contact point. The parent Plan-Net profile indicates this is a Must Support element but is optional, So it can be excluded since there is no source."
* telecom.period -> "No Source. May be excluded from the mapping. Note: This is a GAP in HSDS. In FHIR, this data element captures the time period when the contact point was/is in use. But it can be excluded since there is no source and it is optional."
* address  -> "GAP in HSDS: HSDS does not associate an address directly with an organization. The Location table is used to capture address details associated with locations that are part of that organization. Two HSDS tables are used to represent the postal versus physical address for locations in version 2.0.1, HSDS postal_address and HSDS physical_address. Address information is based on linking organization.id =   location.organization_id and location.id = address.location_id. If there are multiple locations/associated addresses, all addresses can be included for organization level addresses since there is no way to identify which location or address is the primary one to be used as the organization's headquarter address."
* address.id  -> "postal_address.id or physical_address_id Note: This data element may be ignored as having the id for the address record  isn't essential. If populated, it should be the id from one of the address tables that particular address  is referring to."
